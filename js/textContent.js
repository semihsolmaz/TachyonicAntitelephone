    "Vertical gray line represents the time dimension, upwards is future and downwards is past.",
    "Dashed yellow lines represent light cones that mark the speed of light.",
    "Top cone is Ahmet's accessible future, Ahmet can only affect this part of spacetime since in modern physics information cannot travel faster than light.",
    "Bottom cone is Ahmet's accessible past, similarly Ahmet couldn't have been affected by anything outside of its accessible past.",
    "World lines represents things' movement in space time, the world line of a stationary observer " +
    "Ahmet looks like the green line. Ahmet's world line cannot go out of accessible future considering he cannot travel faster than light.",
    "A tachyonic antitelephone is a hypothetical device in theoretical physics. Theoretically, it is used for sending messages to someone's " +
    "own past. Albert Einstein presented a thought experiment in 1907 demonstrating how faster-than-light signals can break causality," +
    "the experiment described by Einstein and Arnold Sommerfeld in 1910 as a means 'to telegraph into the past'.",
    "Lets demonstrate a tachyonic antitelephone on a Minkowski diagram.",
    "The question we are trying to answer here is that what if a message could travel faster than the speed of light? Whatâ€™s this got to do with time travel?",
    "We will say there are two people involved: Ahmet and Kamil. Ahmet is stationary on earth (green line) and Kamil is travelling away from the Ahmet at some " +
    "relativistic speed (blue line) about 50% of the speed of light. And both a have machine that is capable to send instantaneous messages. Their world lines are shown in diagram",
    "At some point Ahmet sends an instantaneous message to Kamil (purple line tagged query). The message will look like as on the left diagram from Ahmet's rest frame.",
    "Now suppose that as soon as Kamil gets the message, he sends a message back to the Ahmet using his own instantaneous communication machine.",
    "First lets draw the line represent Kamil's 'present' at that moment (remember messages are sent and received instantaneously)",
    "We need to adjust Kamil's present line with Lorentz transformation (he is moving with a relative velocity of 0.5c)",
    "Since messages are instantaneous, Kamil's reply will look like the purple line tagged 'Reply'",
    "We can see the problem now, Kamil's reply arrives on the Ahmet's timeline before the Ahmet sends his query.",
    " Assume Ahmet asked a question in the query and Kamil replied with answer, since Ahmet gets the answer before he asks for it, he will not need to send the query. This is paradoxical!"
